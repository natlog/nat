# nat

> The natural unit of information (symbol _nat_), is a unit of information or entropy, based on natural logarithms and powers of _e_, rather than the powers of 2 and base 2 logarithms, which define the bit. This unit is also known by its unit symbol, the nat. The nat is the natural unit for information entropy. Physical systems of natural units that normalize Boltzmann's constant to 1 are effectively measuring thermodynamic entropy in nats.

When the Shannon entropy is written using a natural logarithm,

it is implicitly giving a number measured in nats.

<sub>__`An alphabetising colony`__ Stigmergy is a powerful tool to analyse processes that involve agents who learn. It can be used to model biological systems, both at their conscious and evolutionary levels of knowledge flow (e.g. [swarm intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence) models are used to profile and predict biological '_SLiM_' sequence motifs<sup class="ref-num" data-refnum="1">[1](#ref1)</sup>), but it can motivate a rethinking of our own information retrieval processes. In this illustration: a [self-conjugate partition](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Self-ConjugatePartition.html) (from a consideration of chain/antichains from permutation-partition pairs<sup class="ref-num" data-refnum="2">[2](#ref2)</sup>).</sub>

expect that the genus distribution of such a chain should be a function of
its length and the genus distribution of the link.
